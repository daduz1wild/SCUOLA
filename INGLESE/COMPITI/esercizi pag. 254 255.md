#### **1. Il Monte Everest e la sua conquista nel 1953**

- **Monte Everest:**
    
    - Fino al XIX secolo, non si sapeva che l'Everest fosse la montagna più alta del mondo.
    - Nel 1856, George Everest scoprì che era la vetta più alta con 8.848 metri.
    - Fino al 1920, la montagna non era accessibile agli europei perché le zone circostanti erano chiuse agli stranieri.
    - Molti tentativi di scalata fallirono, inclusa la spedizione del 1924 in cui George Mallory e Andrew Irvine scomparvero vicino alla cima. I loro corpi furono ritrovati solo nel 1999.
- **La conquista del 1953:**
    
    - Edmund Hillary, nato in Nuova Zelanda nel 1919, inizialmente non mostrava talento per lo sport, ma sviluppò la passione per l’alpinismo.
    - Durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, lavorò come navigatore e in seguito si focalizzò sulla scalata dell’Everest.
    - Nel 1951, l’accesso all’Everest fu permesso agli stranieri. Nel 1953, Hillary si unì a una spedizione britannica guidata da John Hunt.
    - Il 29 maggio 1953, insieme al suo compagno nepalese Tenzing Norgay, raggiunse la vetta e vi rimase per 15 minuti.
    - Al ritorno, entrambi furono celebrati con riconoscimenti ufficiali.
    - Hillary dedicò la sua vita ad aiutare le popolazioni nepalesi costruendo scuole e ospedali.

#### **2. Formazione delle montagne**

- **Tipi di montagne e formazione:**
    - **Montagne piegate:** si formano quando due placche tettoniche collidono. (Es. Alpi in Europa)
    - **Montagne a blocchi di faglia:** si formano per fratture nella crosta terrestre.
    - **Montagne vulcaniche:** create dall’eruzione del magma. (Es. Monte Fuji)
    - **Montagne a cupola:** il magma si accumula sotto la crosta senza eruttare.
    - **Montagne erosionali:** create da vento e pioggia nel tempo.

#### **2. Mountain Formation**

- **Types of Mountains:**
    - **Fold mountains:** Formed when two tectonic plates collide (e.g., Alps).
    - **Fault-block mountains:** Created by cracks in the Earth’s crust.
    - **Volcanic mountains:** Formed by erupting magma (e.g., Mount Fuji).
    - **Dome mountains:** Created when magma pushes up but does not erupt.
    - **Erosional mountains:** Formed by wind and water over time.
### **Soluzione degli esercizi**

## **Exercise 2: Mountain Formation**

**Text Recap:**  
_Types of Mountains:_

- **Fold mountains:** Formed when two tectonic plates collide (e.g., Alps).
- **Fault-block mountains:** Created by cracks in the Earth’s crust.
- **Volcanic mountains:** Formed by erupting magma (e.g., Mount Fuji).
- **Dome mountains:** Created when magma pushes up but does not erupt.
- **Erosional mountains:** Formed by wind and water over time.

### **Questions and Answers**

1. **Question:** List the five types of mountains mentioned in the text.  
    **Answer:**  
    The five types are:
    
    - Fold mountains
    - Fault-block mountains
    - Volcanic mountains
    - Dome mountains
    - Erosional mountains
2. **Question:** What are fold mountains, and can you provide an example?  
    **Answer:**  
    Fold mountains are created when two tectonic plates collide, causing the Earth’s crust to fold. An example of fold mountains is the Alps.
    
3. **Question:** How are fault-block mountains formed?  
    **Answer:**  
    Fault-block mountains form when cracks or fractures (faults) in the Earth’s crust cause large blocks of rock to move or tilt, leading to the uplift of the land.
    
4. **Question:** Describe what makes a volcanic mountain different from the others and give an example.  
    **Answer:**  
    Volcanic mountains are formed by the eruption of magma from beneath the Earth’s surface. When magma reaches the surface and cools, it builds up the mountain around the vent. Mount Fuji is an example of a volcanic mountain.
    
5. **Question:** Explain the formation process of dome mountains.  
    **Answer:**  
    Dome mountains form when magma pushes upward from beneath the Earth’s crust but does not actually erupt. This causes the overlying rock to bulge upward into a dome shape.
    
6. **Question:** What are erosional mountains and what natural processes lead to their formation?  
    **Answer:**  
    Erosional mountains are not created by tectonic forces or volcanic activity but are shaped by the gradual wearing away of the Earth’s surface by natural forces such as wind and water over time.
    
7. **Question:** Which type of mountain is not directly caused by the movement of tectonic plates?  
    **Answer:**  
    Erosional mountains are not directly caused by tectonic movements; instead, they result from long-term erosion by wind and water.

## **Exercise 2: Why Didn't Europeans Climb Everest Before 1920?**

**Explanation:**

- **Restricted Access:** The areas surrounding Mount Everest were closed to foreigners. This was largely due to political and cultural reasons, meaning that European explorers and climbers were not permitted to enter the region.
- **Lack of Knowledge and Infrastructure:** Even if access had been allowed, there was limited knowledge about the mountain’s true height and the extreme difficulties posed by its environment. Early expeditions were hampered by inadequate equipment and insufficient experience in high-altitude climbing.

**Answer:** Europeans did not climb Everest before 1920 because the surrounding regions were closed to foreigners and the necessary knowledge and infrastructure to tackle such a difficult climb were not yet in place.

## **Exercise 4: Identify Which Type of Mountain is NOT Formed by the Movements of the Earth**

**Explanation of Types:**

- **Tectonically Formed Mountains:**  
      - **Fold Mountains, Fault-block Mountains, and Dome Mountains** are all created by movements within the Earth’s crust (tectonic forces).  
      - **Volcanic Mountains** result from magma eruptions, which are also linked to internal Earth processes.
    
- **Erosional Mountains:**  
      - These mountains are formed by the weathering and erosion effects of wind and water over long periods, rather than by tectonic movements.
    

**Answer:** Erosional mountains are not formed by the movements of the Earth (tectonic forces) but rather by the processes of erosion.

## **Exercise 5: Discussion on Why People Climb Mountains**

**Discussion Points:**

- **Challenge and Personal Achievement:**  
    Many climbers are driven by the desire to test their physical and mental limits. Climbing a high and dangerous mountain like Everest is seen as one of the ultimate challenges, and reaching the summit is a significant personal achievement.
    
- **Adventure and Exploration:**  
    Climbing offers a unique adventure. Explorers often seek to experience untouched natural beauty, witness breathtaking views, and go where few have gone before.
    
- **Fame and Recognition:**  
    For some, the act of climbing a famous mountain can bring recognition and respect from the global community. Historic achievements, such as those by Hillary and Tenzing, have inspired many and paved the way for future generations of climbers.
    
- **Connection with Nature:**  
    Climbing also allows people to connect with nature on a profound level. The vast, remote, and often serene environment found at high altitudes can be a source of personal inspiration and reflection.
    
- **Risk vs. Reward:**  
    While many admire the boldness of climbers, mountain climbing is also acknowledged as a risky activity. The danger involved in extreme weather, avalanches, and other hazards means that climbers must carefully weigh the risks against the potential rewards.
    

**Summary Statement:**  
People climb mountains for various reasons, including the thrill of overcoming extreme challenges, the pursuit of adventure, the desire for personal growth and recognition, and the opportunity to experience the natural world in its most raw and beautiful form.

**Amerigo Vespucci: The Italian Explorer**
	
Hello, today I will talk about Amerigo Vespucci, an important Italian explorer. Amerigo was born in Florence in 1454. He became a skilled navigator and went on several expeditions across the Atlantic Ocean. During his travels, he discovered that the lands found by explorers were not part of Asia, but a new continent. Because of his work, a mapmaker named Martin Waldseemüller later named the new continent "America" after him. Amerigo Vespucci wrote letters and reports about his journeys, and his observations helped people better understand the world. He is remembered as a brave explorer who changed the way we see our planet.
