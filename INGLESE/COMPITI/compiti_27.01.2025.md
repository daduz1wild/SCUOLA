**Esercizio 4:**  
_Complete the text below with reported speech._

Hi Ryan,  
I've found a Wi-Fi hotspot here at Reading Festival, so I'm emailing you while I have the chance. We're having a really good time – we saw Arctic Monkeys yesterday and they were brilliant. The weather has been pretty bad, but the sun's shining at this moment. I've been spending a lot of money, so can you put £10 on my account? Mum's already sent me £10, so I’ll ask her again! Have you got my account details? They're written in the red notebook on my bookshelf.  
Love from your big sis, Sally
